##<p align="center"> 1. Introduction </p>
We will be creating a web application which is used to buy and sell content related to games. The users will be able to buy, sell, and bid on games, merchandise, expansion packs, and user created content. Sellers will be able to set the price of the content they are selling. An effect of this is that some content may be put up for free. The web application will have a front end for users to interact with and will sit on top of a backend that does the processing and connects to the database.
